COMP-476 Assignment 1
Winter '20

To folder "COMP-476 A1" is the Unity project folder.
To build it, the only thing that should be done is to add
both provided scenes to the build settings;
Menu.unity MUST have scene index 0
World.unity MUST have scene index 1

No other steps should be recquired to compile.
The code uses .NET 4.x backend and C# 7 features, so this must be enabled as well

Precompiled binaries of the game is available in the folder "Compiled"
Instructions for the game are available in the main menu
